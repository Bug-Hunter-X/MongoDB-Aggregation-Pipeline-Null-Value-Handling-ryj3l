```javascript
//Incorrect aggregation pipeline
db.collection.aggregate([
  {$match: { /* ... */ }},
  {$group: {_id: '$field', count: {$sum: 1}}},
  {$sort: {count: -1}},
  {$limit: 10}
])
//The above code will not work as expected if the field to group by has null values. This is because the $group operator does not include null values in the result set. The correct way to handle this is to use the $cond operator to check for null values and replace them with an empty string or another appropriate value before grouping.
